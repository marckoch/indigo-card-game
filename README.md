# Jetbrains Academy - Indigo Card Game

My solutions for the Jetbrains Academy Problem 'Indigo Card Game'

https://hyperskill.org/projects/214

The solution is build up step by step over several stages. 
Stage 1 is the first and simple one. The following stages 
build up on the previous stages and get more and more advanced.
There are five stages in total.

Because each stage is completely independent of the previous one,
IntelliJ might show some warnings about duplicated code between 
the stages.

## Stage 1

Full game logic and winning condition, but computer still plays stupid: Will always play first card.

    gradle -PmainClass=stage4.MainKt run --console=plain

## Stage 5

Add strategy for computer, make sane choices based on cards on table.
